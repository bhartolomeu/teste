This is a project that intends to help graphic developers to create widgets easier. 
You can use it for your job, for your school work or whatever you want to use this code. 
Can you use this code to program and gain money? Of course you can!But you have to share it with the community, beacuse that's the pourpose: help everyone.

I have been thinking carefully for how to make the original idea to be respected and I have just discovered the "GNU General Public License v3.0",the famous "GLP".
So the copyleft will force everyone to make the code being open source.

I hope you could understand me, for any questions contact bhartolomeu@gmail.com and I will answer as soon as possible.
